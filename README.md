# COMSC_4173_Team_1 - iOS Application

Homescreen buttons and logo work fine. Constraints are compatable from iPhone 5 to 6s.
Next step is to authenticate facebook login and setting up a database with Amazon Web Services.


Update Feb 29, 2016

Facebook framework is working fine and the authentication is working too. I need to work more on UI.

Feel free to have a look at it and let me know what can be improved more.

Coalter started working on it.
